The educational divide in UE regions: linking technological advancement to socioeconomic outcomes

The primary objective of this project is to assess the influence of technological development in various
European regions on their education levels, quantified through the Education Index, which we derived
from multiple variables related to the educational attainment of each region.
Following this, we conducted a detailed analysis of the disparities in education levels across different
European regions by examining their correlation with GDP per capita, corruption levels, employment
rates, and NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) rates. This comprehensive approach pro-
vides insights into the intricate relationship between technological advancement and educational
outcomes, as well as their broader socioeconomic implications.
